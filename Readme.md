# Molecular Weight Calculator Library

The MwtWinDll is a .NET library with utility functions for calculating the
molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids.
It recognizes user-definable abbreviations and custom elemental isotopes.
It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow 
Modeller, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Isotopic Distribution Calculator, 
and Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeller.  To use, simply include the 
DLL in a .NET project.

### Continuous Integration

Obtain the DLL from the [AppVeyor CI server](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PNNLCompMassSpec/molecular-weight-calculator-dll/build/artifacts)
