	- Fix some long-broken functionality
	- Add COM Interface support to replace the VB6 COM/ActiveX DLL (includes 64-bit support)

	- Fix bug in clsMwtWin.vb
		- Load defaults (and call MemoryLoadAll) prior to instantiating the peptide class
	- Remove unnecessary ByRef keywords

	- Validated formula finder thorough and bounded modes against the VB6 results

Version 3.5.5794; November 12, 2015
	- Finalizing the target mass search mode algorithm

Version 3.5.5792; November 10, 2015
	- Added clsFormulaFinder

Version 3.5.5387; October 1, 2014
	- Added ToString() to clsPeptideClass

Version 3.5.4637; September 11, 2012

Version 3.4.4518; May 15, 2012
	- Added parameter blnAddProtonChargeCarrier to ComputeIsotopicAbundances

Version 3.4.3989; December 3, 2010
	- Added several public constants to clsPeptideClass.vb

Version 3.4.3935; October 10, 2010
	- Changed the iteration tracking variables in ComputeIsotopicAbundancesInternal and ConvoluteMasses to be 64-bit integers
		- PredictedConvIterations surpassed the 32-bit integer boundary for isotopic formula C489 H300 F27 Fe8 N72 Ni6 O27 S9

Version 3.4.3848; July 15, 2010
	- Minor code updates

Version 3.4.3730; March 19, 2010
	- Changed many of the functions to use overloaded function definitions instead of Optional function parameters
		- Allows MwtWinDll.dll to be C# compatible
	- Fixed bug that always reported a mass of 0 when calling clsMwtWin.ComputeMass()

Version 3.3.3709; February 26, 2010
	- Converted to Visual Studio 2008
	- Added progress events
		- Removed references to ProgressFormNET.dll (it was previously only used in ComputeIsotopicAbundancesInternal)
	- Added option to log messages to a file

Version 3.2.3576; October 16, 2009
	- Added support for c and z ions in function GetFragmentationMasses()

Version 3.2.2944; January 23, 2008
	- Removed dependence on SharedVBNetRoutines.dll
	
Version 3.1.2687; May 11, 2007
	- Updated ComputeIsotopicAbundancesInternal to properly interpret Charge state
		- If intChargeState=0, then returns neutral masses
		- If intChargeState=1, then returns M+H masses
		- If intChargeState>1, then returns convoluted m/z masses
	- Updated ConvoluteMassInternal to convert from neutral mass to M+H and to return 0 if the current charge or desired charge is 0
	 - Added option to include 3+ fragmentation ions in the GetFragmentationMasses() function

Version 3.1.2161; December 1, 2005
	- Updated the Mass member of type udtIsotopeInfoType to be double precision rather than single precision
	- Updated the mass of the most abundant isotope for each element to match the default monoisotopic mass for each element
		- The elemental masses come from two different sources and the monoisotopic mass was sometimes slightly different than the most abundant isotope's mass; this has been corrected

Version 3.1.2110; October 11, 2005
	- Replaced all instances of On Error Goto and On Error Resume Next to use Try-Catch blocks
	- Replaced all instances where a value is returned from a function to use the Return statement
	- Updated AppRevision to use the Revision number from AssemblyInfo.vb
	- Updated the copyright statements to assert the Apache License, Version 2.0

Version 3.0; March 23, 2005
	- Ported from VB6 to VB.NET by Nikša Blonder
