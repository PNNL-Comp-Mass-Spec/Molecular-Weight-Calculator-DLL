WPFMath is available on NuGet, with the version (as of April 23, 2021) 0.9.0. This happens to have a bug that throws an exception whenever you try to set the text font.

I downloaded the source as of April 6, 2021 (commit 4860622), which includes the fix for that bug, and gave it a version of 0.9.1. Whenever 0.10.0 is released, the NuGet package can be used instead of this DLL, and this entire folder can be deleted.
