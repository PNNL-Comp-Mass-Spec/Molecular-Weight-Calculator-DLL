MwtWinDll.NET Change Log

Version 3.1.2161; December 1, 2005
	- Updated the Mass member of type udtIsotopeInfoType to be double precision rather than single precision
	- Updated the mass of the most abundant isotope for each element to match the default monoisotopic mass for each element
		- The elemental masses come from two different sources and the monoisotopic mass was sometimes slightly different than the most abundant isotope's mass; this has been corrected

Version 3.1.2110; October 11, 2005
	- Replaced all instances of On Error Goto and On Error Resume Next to use Try-Catch blocks
	- Replaced all instances where a value is returned from a function to use the Return statement
	- Updated AppRevision to use the Revision number from AssemblyInfo.vb
	- Updated the copyright statements to assert the Apache License, Version 2.0
