# __<span style="color:#D57500">Molecular Weight Calculator - .NET DLL Version</span>__
 .NET DLL version of the Molecular Weight Calculator, supporting a range of molecular weight calculations for both chemical formulas and amino acids.

### Description
The MwtWinDll.NET program contains utility functions for calculating the molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids. It recognizes user-definable abbreviations and custom elemental isotopes. It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow Modeller, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Isotopic Distribution Calculator, and Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeler. Although the DLL is a VB.NET application, it is C# compatible.

To use the MwtWinDll.NET program you need to include it in a .NET project. The [Peptide Fragmentation Modeller](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Peptide-Fragmentation-Modeller) program is a simple VB.NET command-line application that demonstrates the use of the MwtWinDll.NET program. Also available for download is a simple C# demo application that demonstrates the use of MwtWinDll.dll with C sharp.

See also the desktop version of the [Molecular Weight Calculator](https://pnnl-comp-mass-spec.github.io/Molecular-Weight-Calculator-VB6/) (which is written in VB6).
